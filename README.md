<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Getting a serverâ€™s attention at a restaurant can be very difficult. Whether you are waiting for a 
spoon, a napkin, or even the bill. Servers can be very busy serving other tables and can forget 
2
about a request you have made. A customer can get frustrated waiting for a simple request, and it 
can potentially have a negative impact on their dining experience. Restaurant Management 
System (RMS) is a mobile app that aims to solve this issue and improve the dining experience 
for both the customer and the server. The app intends to provide faster and more efficient 
service.

RMS - mobile is a CSC 4996 Senior Capstone project at Wayne State University. With the idea proposed by client Dr. Seyed Mojab, the application was developed by a team of 4 Computer Science students.
